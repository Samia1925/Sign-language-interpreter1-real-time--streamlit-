# Sign-language-interpreter1-real-time--streamlit-

It is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based project. The xyz.py file is an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system. 

This AI project leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)-CNN to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures in real-time. The system utilizes MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and a TensorFlow Lite model for gesture classification. Users can interact with the system via a Streamlit interface that allows starting and stopping the camera feed. The detected hand gestures are processed and classified into ASL letters, with the results displayed on the screen along with the confidence levels of the predictions. This tool aims to assist in the recognition and learning of ASL. ​

To run this "smnist_X5_lite.tflite" must be in the same folder.

streamlit, cv2, mediapipe, numpy,  tensorflow, os must be imported.

In terminal run : streamlit run #absolute path of "xyz.py"#
